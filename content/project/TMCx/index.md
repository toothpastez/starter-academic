This was my biggest responsibility at ttweak LLC: managing post production on the biannual video package for the Texas Medical Center startup accelerator, TMCx. 

Twice a year, ttweak would be hired to produced a 20-25 video media package for TMCx's Demo Day event, which included a kick-off video, and an intro video for each presenting company. My responsibilities for this project were to edit the sizzle, and to either edit, or post-produce the walk-on video for up to 24 companies in each TMCx cohort. This included rush edits, giving feedback to multiple remote editors, communicating with TMC staff and startup CEOs on video content and messaging, managing my own editing workload, and then finally coordinating uniform graphics, managing the finishing workflow, and proofing everything on-site with the event staff.
