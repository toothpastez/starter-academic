Every six months, ttweak LLC produces a 20+ video media package for the Texas Medical Center's startup accelerator, TMCx. 

For each company in the biannual med device and digital technology cohort between 2017 and 2020, ttweak produced 1 to 2 introductory videos, and for each cohorts' live demo day, we rush edited a 5-7 minute sizzle video to ramp people up for the company presentations. From co shooting broll and interviews, to ingest, to prepping and managing teams of editors, to collaborating with dozens of startup entrepreneurs on their company messages, to facilitating coordination between finishing professionals and live event coordinators -along with editing or overseeing 15-25 overlaping edits per package- I was the point person for the entire post production process for the TMCx video package. To date, I have had a direct role in producing video content for 100+ companies at the TMC innovation institute.
