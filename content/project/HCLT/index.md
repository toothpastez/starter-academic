This film was for one of my favorite ttweak clients: Houston Community Land Trust. HCLT is a brilliant organization actively housing Houstonians using the time-tested community land trust model. As part of the ttweak team, I had the priveledge of assistant producing, co shooting, and editing this explainer and fundraising film commissioned by HCLT.
