ttweak was comissioned to create this "Promises Made, Promises Kept" piece to update the St. Johns community on the completion of their capital campaign and campus expansion. My roles in this project included second camera and editor.

The below pieces were part of an online viewbook project for St. Johns, where ttweak created a series of short videos designed to introduced new students and parents to the St. Johns experience. My role in these projects was as editor.
