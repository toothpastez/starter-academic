Amazing Place is a dementia day program serving the Houston area with daily social and health oriented activities for their participants, and by providing education and a support network to their community's caregivers. This is another ttweak client whom I am always thrilled to work for. I do some shooting for Amazing Place, and am mainly involved as editor.
